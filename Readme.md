# LeetCode Solutions - NeetCode Roadmap

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, following the **NeetCode.io Roadmap**. The goal is to systematically tackle coding challenges while improving my problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and understanding of data structures.

## üìö **Purpose**
- To build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms.
- To prepare for technical interviews with a structured and efficient approach.
- To track progress as I complete problems categorized by difficulty and topic.

## üöÄ **Structure**
The repository is organized based on the NeetCode.io roadmap topics, including:
- Arrays & Hashing
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Binary Search
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- And more...

Each topic has its own folder containing solutions to related problems.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Approach**
1. **Problem Solving**: For each problem, I follow these steps:
   - Understand the problem requirements.
   - Devise a solution plan with pseudocode.
   - Implement the solution in Python (or the chosen programming language).
   - Optimize the code to improve time and space complexity.
2. **Documentation**: Each solution includes:
   - Problem description.
   - Explanation of the approach and algorithm.
   - Time and space complexity analysis.
3. **Testing**: Solutions are tested with a variety of edge cases and examples.

## üåü **Why NeetCode.io?**
NeetCode.io provides a well-curated roadmap that prioritizes the most important problems for mastering data structures and algorithms. This ensures a focused and efficient learning experience.

## ü§ù **Contributing**
